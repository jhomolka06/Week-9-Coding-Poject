                <p>Having an nice lawn in southeast Nebraska is not that hard. Here I will share with you some of my ideas on how to maintain a cheap lawn.</p>

                <h3>Spring Time</h3>
                <p>As you may know, springtime in Nebraska is from the beginning of March to the end of May. During this time, there is usually a lot of rain, so you. don't need to water too much. At this point, I wouldn't do anything to the lawn. Wait until the end of May.</p>

                <h3>Summer Time</h3>
                <p>As you may know, summertime in Nebraska is from the beginning of June to the end of September. In the beginning of June, I would put down granular fertilizer for lawns which you can find at any hardware store. If you decide to add fertilizer and it does not rain, you will need to water deeply at least once every two weeks or your grass will burn up and turn brown from the fertilizer and lack of water. I also would broadcast a granular product called Bonide Crabgrass and broadleaf weed preventer. Here in Nebraska, I have to order this product either from ebay, Amazon, or Walmart and it is relatively cheap. I have gotten it anywhere from $12 to $35 for 5000 square feet. This product is great because it has a pre emergent and post emergent for both crabgrass and broad leaf weeds. So it will kill what is there and protect your lawn from any weeds that might sprout after you applied the product. If you apply this June 1st it will easily make it all the way through the summer, with one application. If you don't like to water your lawn, then try to get it spread out right before it rain. This product is amazing for the price.  </p>

                <p>Also, during the summer I would. get a product called Roundup for Lawns and spray your lawn with that about August 1st. This product will kill everything except your existing grass which gives you a nice clean slate to spread grass seed on September 1st. With this product, you have to wait four weeks after applying it to spread grass seed. I would just follow the directions and apply it with a two gallon pump sprayer. Two gallons should easily do 1500 square feet.</p>

                

                <h3>Fall Time</h3>
                <p>The first thing I would do starting September 1st is methodically set up sprinklers on the edge of the house, sidewalks, and flower beds. Trying to keep the hose out of the way of long mowing and In such a way that you can leave it there for the next month and a half without moving it. I'd like to use a item that I found on Amazon that is a smartphone controlled water manifold for your outdoor faucet. With this product, you can have four outlets and as many timers set for as long as you want them to go off and it will do it all automatically on its own. This product actually allows you to save a lot of water and it keeps your new grass seed wet throughout the day. You want to water it for about 15 minutes, four times a day. After you're sure that you can get your grass seed watered four times a day for the next month then its time to spread your grass seed to overseed your existing grass. I would personally recommend a turf type tall fescue or better yet a tall fescue called RTF. The RTf can spread through the roots and fill in bear spots itself. The plain turf type tall fescue cannot do that. It needs to be overseated every year or every other year. They are both very good because they are drought tolerat, disease resistant, and high traffic tollerant. Your grass should be ready to cut after 4 weeks from overseeding. You dont want to cut it shorter than three inches. You will want to drain your garden hoses and pick up your sprinklers after October 15th here in Nebraska because it will freeze.And that is all you will just repeat next year. unless the grass looks good enough to where you think you don't need to overseed.</p>
